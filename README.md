# BMW Showcase Website

This project is a showcase website for BMW, demonstrating a modern, responsive web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Key Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobiles).
*   **Model Showcase:** Detailed pages for various BMW models, highlighting their features, specifications, and images.
*   **Gallery:** A visually appealing gallery to browse through high-quality images of BMW cars.
*   **Informational Pages:** Static pages like "About Us" to provide more context about the brand or dealership.

## Technologies Used

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and a great developer experience.
*   **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Available Pages

*   **Home:** The landing page of the website.
*   **About:** Information about the BMW brand or dealership.
*   **Models:** A section to explore different BMW models.
*   **Gallery:** A collection of BMW car images.
